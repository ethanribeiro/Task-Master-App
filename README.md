# Task Master

Task Master is a task management app that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Users can also mark tasks as completed. It is heavily inspired by the default Vue To-Do List project that every new Vue developer experiences making, as they begin to become accustomed to the framework. This approach involves implimenting a local browser data base (IndexedDB) to save task objects to your local broswer's storage, so that you can mantain your personal tasks on your device's browser. This project took me 3 days to complete, which in all those 3 days, exposing me to the Vue framework for the first time and using my new software engineering skills to adapt and master as much as I could to create said project to prove that my fundimental understanding of the JavaScript framework is experienced enough to take on any new challenge and overcome it with enough hard work and dedication.
